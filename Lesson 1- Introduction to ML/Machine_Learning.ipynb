So, if the data provided has some errors and biases same properties of the data will be summarized by the ML algorithm. As the data can be in form of text, speech, images or videos are all created by the humans and will definetely have some hidden biases. So, to eliminate the biases we can generate synthetic data (More on this later) to bridge the gap and make the ML algorithms robust and accurate for the inference.\n",
